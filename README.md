LEVEL 1. Beginner

I love workout. I want you to design an app that can help me workout.

As soon as I open the app, It selects 5 exercise for me in the background. Then it asks me number of sets that I want to do. Number for set will remain same for all exercise.

Every exercise will have different duration.
For ex: pushpus - 5 mins
crunches: 4 mins
plank: 40 seconds


Break duration is fixed: 40 seconds

I should be able to see, all exercise that app has selected for me. Once I hit start workout button. App will play music for the duration of exercise. To indicate that there is a break, music will stop and will resume as soon as break is over.



LEVEL 2. Assuming you have read above instructions carefully, here are additional features.
a. Add a random button, which can again select different exercise.
b. Different music for every exercise.

3. Advance:
With all the above features. App will be working in 2 modes. Random mode and daywise mode. As soon as I open the app, it will ask me to select the mode.

In day wise mode, Based on the day, 5 exercises are given to the user and user cannot change it.

NOTE:
1. I love card based UI.
2. Use our logo and assets

1. Data Visualization like piecharts,graphs to indicate user progress
